    "\n",
    "[**Jupyter**](https://docs.jupyter.org/en/latest) provides a convenient solution for coding in Python. *This file* is a Jupyter notebook (.ipynb), where Python code is divided into individual and independent cells, where the output of each cell is displayed below the cell when it is run. These cells *can* be run in any order you like, but it is in good form to place them in such a way that the notebook can always be run from top to bottom without errors. [This blog post](https://florianwilhelm.info/2018/11/working_efficiently_with_jupyter_lab/) provides a very in-depth look at some best practices when using Jupyter.\n",
    "\n",
    "[**Markdown**](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/) renders blocks of text with user-defined formatting. Any cell in a Jupyter notebook can also be a collapsible Markdown cell, and it is highly recommended that these are used in such a way that **every notebook is a clear story told with words (Markdown) and code (Python).** Use the [Markdown Cheat Sheet](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/) as a reference.\n",

    "\n",
    "Data Type | Examples | Notes\n",
    ":---: | --- | ---\n",
    "integer | `-2`, `5`, `0` |\n",
    "float | `1.3`, `3.1415927`, `-3.2223` |\n",
    "boolean | `True`, `False` |\n",
    "string | `\"hello\"`, `\"32\"` | Strings actually act like \"lists\" of characters\n",
    "list | `[1, 2, 3]`, `[\"a\", 2, 3.0]` | We can access elements using `[]`, like `my_list[2]`\n",
    "set | `{\"a\", 2, True}`, `{None}`, `{2}` |\n",
    "dictionary | `{\"a\": 12, \"c\": 3}`, `{\"a\": [1, 2], \"c\": 3}` | Similar to lists, we use the key. E.g., `my_dictionary[\"a\"]`\n",
    "tuple | `(3)`, `(1, 5)` | These can also be indexed like lists and dictionaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Caveats**\n",
    "* The `None` in the second `set` example is actually a \"None Type\" data type. It is usually used to represent a missing or non-existent value.\n",
    "* It is possible to have multiple kinds of data types within a list, set, or tuple.\n",
    "* Iterables (like lists) and strings can be sliced using `[start:stop:step]` syntax.\n",
    "    - **Python is zero-indexed.** So, the `0`th index is actually the first value.\n",
    "    - The `stop` value is excluded from the result. So, `[2:4]` results in the 3rd and 4th elements."

I.e., instead of writing the same block of code multiple times, we simply call a single function â€” it saves room and keeps things clean. In the same way that functions (and classes) can be imported from third-party (or built-in) packages, they can also be imported from modules we build ourselves!\n",
